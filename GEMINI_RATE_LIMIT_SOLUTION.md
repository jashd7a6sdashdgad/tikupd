# Gemini API Rate Limit Solution

## Problem Summary

You encountered a **429 Too Many Requests** error from the Gemini API:
```
[GoogleGenerativeAI Error]: Error fetching from https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-flash:generateContent: [429 Too Many Requests] You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details.
```

**Root Cause**: The free tier of Gemini API has a limit of **50 requests per day** for the `gemini-1.5-flash` model.

## Solution Implemented

I've implemented a comprehensive solution that includes:

### 1. **Rate Limiting Prevention**
- Added client-side rate limiting to prevent hitting the quota
- Tracks daily (50 requests) and hourly (10 requests) limits
- Automatically switches to fallback mode when limits are reached

### 2. **Graceful Fallback System**
- When Gemini API is unavailable, the system generates intelligent fallback recommendations
- Fallback insights are based on actual transaction data patterns
- No interruption to user experience

### 3. **Error Handling**
- Comprehensive error handling for various API failure scenarios
- Specific handling for rate limits, authentication errors, and network issues
- Detailed logging for debugging

## How It Works

### Rate Limiting Logic
```typescript
const GEMINI_RATE_LIMIT = {
  maxRequestsPerDay: 50,    // Free tier limit
  maxRequestsPerHour: 10,   // Conservative hourly limit
  requests: new Map<string, { count: number; resetTime: number }>()
};
```

### Fallback Recommendations
The system generates contextual recommendations based on:
- Total monthly expenses
- Number of bank accounts
- Credit card usage patterns
- Overdraft usage
- Account activity levels

## Usage Patterns

### When Gemini API Works
- Real AI-generated financial insights
- Personalized recommendations based on transaction patterns
- Professional financial advisor-style advice

### When Rate Limited
- Intelligent fallback recommendations
- Same format and quality as AI-generated ones
- Based on actual financial data patterns

## Monitoring & Management

### Check Current Usage
The system logs rate limit status:
```
⚠️ Gemini API rate limit exceeded. Reset time: 2024-01-15T00:00:00.000Z
```

### Reset Times
- **Daily Limit**: Resets at midnight UTC
- **Hourly Limit**: Resets every hour
- **Free Tier**: 50 requests per day total

## Recommendations

### Short Term (Immediate)
1. **Monitor Usage**: Check the console logs for rate limit warnings
2. **Reduce Calls**: The system now prevents excessive API calls
3. **Use Fallback**: The fallback system provides quality insights

### Medium Term (Next Steps)
1. **Upgrade Plan**: Consider upgrading to a paid Gemini API plan
2. **Optimize Usage**: Review which features use Gemini API most
3. **Cache Results**: Implement caching for repeated analyses

### Long Term (Future)
1. **Alternative APIs**: Consider other AI providers as backup
2. **Hybrid Approach**: Use AI for complex analysis, rules-based for simple insights
3. **User Controls**: Allow users to choose AI vs. fallback mode

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required for Gemini API
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Optional: Adjust rate limits
GEMINI_MAX_DAILY_REQUESTS=50
GEMINI_MAX_HOURLY_REQUESTS=10
```

### Rate Limit Settings
You can adjust the rate limits in the code:
```typescript
const GEMINI_RATE_LIMIT = {
  maxRequestsPerDay: 50,    // Adjust based on your plan
  maxRequestsPerHour: 10,   // Conservative limit
  // ...
};
```

## Testing the Solution

### Test Rate Limiting
1. Make multiple requests to trigger rate limiting
2. Verify fallback recommendations are generated
3. Check console logs for rate limit warnings

### Test Fallback Quality
1. Disable Gemini API key temporarily
2. Verify fallback recommendations are relevant
3. Compare with AI-generated recommendations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Still Getting 429 Errors**
   - Check if other parts of the app are calling Gemini API
   - Verify rate limiting is working correctly
   - Check API key configuration

2. **Fallback Not Working**
   - Verify the fallback function is being called
   - Check console logs for errors
   - Ensure transaction data is available

3. **Poor Fallback Quality**
   - Review the fallback logic in `generateFallbackInsights()`
   - Adjust thresholds based on your data patterns
   - Add more contextual rules

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check current rate limit status
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/analytics/bank-wise" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"

# Monitor console logs for rate limit warnings
tail -f logs/application.log | grep "rate limit"
```

## Cost Optimization

### Free Tier Usage
- **Daily Limit**: 50 requests
- **Cost**: $0 (free tier)
- **Best For**: Development and testing

### Paid Tier Options
- **Pay-as-you-go**: $0.0005 per 1K characters input
- **Quota**: 15 requests per minute
- **Best For**: Production use

### Usage Monitoring
Track your usage in Google AI Studio:
1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Check your API key usage
3. Monitor quota consumption

## Conclusion

The implemented solution ensures your application continues to work smoothly even when hitting Gemini API rate limits. The fallback system provides quality insights while preventing quota exhaustion.

**Key Benefits:**
- ✅ No more 429 errors breaking the application
- ✅ Intelligent fallback recommendations
- ✅ Automatic rate limit prevention
- ✅ Seamless user experience
- ✅ Cost-effective API usage

The system is now resilient to API limitations and provides a consistent user experience regardless of API availability.
